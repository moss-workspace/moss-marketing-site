    and sorting. Emptying the trash. A rote process built for rote tasks. After 40
    years we’ve universally accepted this workspace as status-quo. '

  title_2: But what if your work was never meant for the cubicle?
  body_2: What if your process doesn’t fit neatly into a box, but rather demands thinking
    outside of one?
creativity_section:
  title: What about creativity?
  body: The creative process is messy, and fragile. It requires cultivation. Care.
    Room to grow. A space designed specifically for it, not in spite of it.

why_section:
  title: 'That’s why we’re building Moss. '
  body: |-
    No more office-work. No more sifting, sorting, digging. No more asking where, why and what. the. fuck.

    No more missing out on the unexpected chemistry that happens when everything is at your fingertips. No more workarounds to compensate for a workspace that was never even made for us.

final_section:
  title: Moss transforms the desktop from a rigid, siloed system into an open and
    collaborative digital environment.
  body: A workflow tool as fluid as creativity itself. Where you can organize, experiment,
    and iterate together in one place.
