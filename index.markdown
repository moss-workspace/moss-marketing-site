  body_1: 'It was designed to emulate the office, and with it – office-work. Sifting
    and sorting. Emptying the trash. A rote process built for rote tasks. After 40
    years we’ve universally accepted this workspace as status-quo. '
  body_2: But what if your work was never meant for the cubicle? What if your process
    doesn’t fit neatly into a box, but rather demands thinking outside of one?

  title: What about creativity?
  body: The creative process is messy, and fragile. It requires cultivation. Care.
